    "Crumble is our 11 year old Cockerpoo who is set in his routine, and very attached to me and my husband. He is rarely alone, and naturally, I was concerned leaving him for more than a couple of days to go on holiday. Polly came to our rescue and stayed at our home taking care of our beloved boy with a mix of absolute professionalism and great affection and calm. For the 5 nights we were away, I received many photo and film updates of our beloved boy having a simply wonderful time! It was such a relief to be able to relax, knowing that our home and our dog were being so well looked after. I highly recommend Polly (and Hue) and will definitely use her services again. I think he misses her...",

          "Paulina was a fantastic dogsitter for Bella. From the first contact she was communicative and accommodating, reassuring me that both pup and home were in safe hands. And in safe thanks they were, she played with Bella, got her to eat (fussy breed) and tired her out through play. I couldn't recommend her enough. Thank you Paulina for making it so easy to have peace of mind.",

          "Polly took good care of both of our puppies and we can recommend her. We were a bit nervous leaving them especially as they were still quite young and attached to us, but Polly's patience won them over and they cuddled up with her only after a couple of hours. Plenty of updates from Polly made us feel at ease and we wouldn't hesitate to book her again.",

          "Paulina is a fantastic dog sitter! We left our 12 week old puppy with her at our house over Christmas and he was super happy and calm the whole time. The house was also spotless when we got home! Paulie clearly knows and loves dogs and takes great care to keep them happy and well cared for. We would definitely invite Paulie back again to help with our dog.",

We needed her to look after them while we were out for most of the evening. I had half hourly photos and updates, she played and cuddled and took them out for toilet breaks. Our home was left clean and our babies were sleeping and happy when we got home. Definitely a caring and loving dog sitter. Would 100% recommend.",
