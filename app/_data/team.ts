    bio: "As a dog walker and pet sitter, my number one priority is the wellbeing of your four-legged family member. I understand how important it is to trust the person you are leaving your furry friend with, which is why I strive to gain that trust through reliable visits, level-headed thinking and an understanding of each pet’s individual needs. During my walks, their tail will always be wagging! I provide quality time for your pet by engaging in stimulating activities catered specifically to them such as running around the block or playing tug-of-war in the park. No matter if it's a group outing or an individual walk, I make sure every pup gets plenty of attention from me at all times. Not only do I take care of your precious pup while you're away, but also get out and about; exploring parks and discovering gems around every corner. Thanks to my flexible schedule, I'm also able to extend pet sitting services if needed - so that your fur babe can still enjoy their daily routine even when you're not home. If you're looking for someone passionate about providing personalized service and experienced in caring for pets then look no further - because that's just what I bring to the table!",
